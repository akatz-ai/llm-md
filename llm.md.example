# LLM Context Configuration

# This file controls which files are included in the LLM context output.
# Patterns follow gitignore syntax.

INCLUDE:
# If this section exists and has patterns, ONLY files matching these patterns will be included
# Leave this section empty or remove it to include all files (except those ignored by .gitignore and EXCLUDE)
# Examples:
# src/**/*.py
# docs/*.md
# config.yaml

EXCLUDE:
# Files matching these patterns will be excluded (in addition to .gitignore)
# This section is always additive to .gitignore rules
# Examples:
# tests/**
# *.test.js
# build/
# temp*
