# LLM Context Configuration

# This file controls which files are included in the LLM context output.
# Patterns follow gitignore syntax.

ONLY:
# When this section has patterns, ONLY these files will be included,
# ignoring ALL exclusions (.gitignore, EXCLUDE, hidden files, binary files)
# Use this for strict whitelisting
# Examples:
# src/**/*.py
# docs/*.md
# README.md

INCLUDE:
# Files matching these patterns will be rescued from exclusions
# (they'll be included even if gitignored, hidden, or excluded)
# Use this to include specific files that would normally be filtered out
# Examples:
# .github/workflows/*.yml
# .env.example
# build/dist.js

EXCLUDE:
# Files matching these patterns will be excluded (in addition to .gitignore)
# This section is always additive to .gitignore rules
# Examples:
# tests/**
# *.test.js
# build/
# temp*

# Notes:
# - Sections can appear in any order
# - Empty sections are ignored
# - Use "NOT INCLUDE:" as an alternative name for "EXCLUDE:"
# - CLI options take precedence over patterns in this file
