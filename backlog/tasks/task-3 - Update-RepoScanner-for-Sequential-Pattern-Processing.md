## Description

The current RepoScanner uses precedence-based logic with ONLY/INCLUDE/EXCLUDE patterns. With the new mode-based format, the scanner needs to implement sequential processing where patterns are applied in order. This requires mode-aware initial file set creation and support for the new options that control default exclusions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Scanner creates initial file set based on mode (empty for WHITELIST all files for BLACKLIST)
- [x] Default exclusions are applied based on options (respect_gitignore include_hidden include_binary)
- [x] Pattern sections are processed sequentially in order
- [x] WHITELIST mode adds files matching implicit and INCLUDE patterns
- [x] BLACKLIST mode removes files matching implicit and EXCLUDE patterns
- [x] Options flags override default exclusion behavior
- [x] Scanner works with updated parser interface
- [x] All existing tests pass or are updated
- [x] New tests cover sequential processing scenarios
## Implementation Plan

1. Add options parameters to RepoScanner constructor
2. Rewrite scan() method for sequential processing
3. Create _get_all_files() method for initial file discovery
4. Create _apply_default_exclusions() respecting options
5. Create _process_section() for pattern application
6. Update _should_skip_file() to respect options
7. Write comprehensive tests for new logic

## Implementation Notes

### Approach Taken
- Implemented mode-based sequential pattern processing to replace precedence-based logic
- Used TDD approach with comprehensive test suite (8 new tests) before implementation
- Maintained backward compatibility with legacy ONLY/INCLUDE/EXCLUDE format
- Applied SOLID principles with clean separation of concerns

### Features Implemented
- **New scan() method**: Detects mode from parser and routes to sequential or legacy processing
- **_get_all_files()**: Discovers all files including those in normally skipped directories
- **_apply_default_exclusions()**: Respects options for gitignore, hidden files, and binary files
- **_process_section()**: Processes pattern sections sequentially with proper add/remove logic
- **_should_include_file()**: Evaluates default exclusions for WHITELIST/INCLUDE operations
- **_scan_legacy()**: Fallback for legacy format ensuring no regressions

### Technical Decisions and Trade-offs
- **File discovery strategy**: Created separate `_walk_absolutely_all_directories()` to access all files, enabling options like `respect_gitignore: false` to work properly
- **Sequential vs precedence**: Chose sequential processing for predictable, order-dependent behavior vs the previous precedence-based approach
- **Memory vs performance**: Used Set operations for efficient add/remove during processing, converting to sorted list only at the end
- **Compatibility**: Maintained dual-mode support (new + legacy) to prevent breaking changes

### Modified Files
- **src/llmd/scanner.py**: Major refactor with new methods and updated scan() logic
- **tests/test_patterns.py**: Added TestSequentialPatternProcessing class with 8 comprehensive tests
- **scratchpad/task-3-reposcanner-sequential-processing-ultrathink.md**: Detailed planning and implementation notes

### Test Results
- **All legacy tests**: 9/9 passing (no regressions)
- **New sequential tests**: 8/8 passing (all scenarios covered)
- **Parser integration tests**: 26/26 passing
- **Total test coverage**: 43/43 tests passing
- **Code quality**: Ruff linter passed with no issues
