## Description

The current RepoScanner uses precedence-based logic with ONLY/INCLUDE/EXCLUDE patterns. With the new mode-based format, the scanner needs to implement sequential processing where patterns are applied in order. This requires mode-aware initial file set creation and support for the new options that control default exclusions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Scanner creates initial file set based on mode (empty for WHITELIST all files for BLACKLIST)
- [ ] Default exclusions are applied based on options (respect_gitignore include_hidden include_binary)
- [ ] Pattern sections are processed sequentially in order
- [ ] WHITELIST mode adds files matching implicit and INCLUDE patterns
- [ ] BLACKLIST mode removes files matching implicit and EXCLUDE patterns
- [ ] Options flags override default exclusion behavior
- [ ] Scanner works with updated parser interface
- [ ] All existing tests pass or are updated
- [ ] New tests cover sequential processing scenarios

## Implementation Plan

1. Add options parameters to RepoScanner constructor\n2. Rewrite scan() method for sequential processing\n3. Create _get_all_files() method for initial file discovery\n4. Create _apply_default_exclusions() respecting options\n5. Create _process_section() for pattern application\n6. Update _should_skip_file() to respect options\n7. Write comprehensive tests for new logic
